This is a mechanical keyboard using an Arduino Nano ( or any of the knock-offs that running on the ATmega328P)

1) Determine the layout of the keyboard using http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/

After designing the layout to your liking, make sure to save the layout and save the information under the raw data tab. 

I went with a modified version of the 68-key layout with an extra knob.
